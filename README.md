## 🛠️ Project Portfolio

As I complete each module, I'll build projects to put these skills into practice. Here’s a preview of some key projects planned:

1. **Image Recognition App** - A portfolio-ready PWA with offline capabilities and image recognition functionality.
2. **Node.js REST API** - Scalable backend API with Express, JWT, and session management.
3. **Full-Stack MERN App** - A comprehensive app integrating React, Redux, Node.js, and MongoDB.
4. **Serverless Microservices on AWS** - Implementing serverless architecture for high scalability.
5. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup** - A fully automated CI/CD pipeline to streamline deployments.

Each project will have a dedicated folder with its own README, documenting objectives, technologies used, and learnings.
