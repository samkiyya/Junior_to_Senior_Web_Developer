# Junior to Senior Web Developer Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Junior to Senior Web Developer** journey! This repository tracks my progress and learnings through [Zero to Mastery’s Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap/) course. This space is dedicated to my development as a full-stack web developer, and I’m sharing it to help hiring managers get a clear view of my skills and projects—and for others to learn from my path as well!

## 📑 Course Overview

The _Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap_ from Zero to Mastery covers a wide range of topics to help developers transition from junior to senior level. Here, I’m documenting projects, code snippets, and key insights gained throughout the course.

- **Asynchronous JavaScript and Performance Optimization**
- **React & Advanced Frontend Techniques**
- **Backend with Node.js, Express, and Databases**

## 🛠️ Project Portfolio

I’ll be building projects for each module to apply new skills in practical scenarios. Here are a few planned and completed projects:

1. **Asynchronous Data Fetching** - A dynamic data-fetching app using Promises and Async/Await.
2. **React SPA with Redux** - A React Single Page Application featuring state management with Redux.
3. **Node.js REST API** - Building a scalable API with Express and MongoDB.
4. **Full-Stack MERN App** - A full-stack project to integrate frontend and backend skills.

Projects will be added as individual folders in this repository with README files that detail project objectives, technologies used, and key learning outcomes.
